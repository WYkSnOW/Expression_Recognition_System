st.markdown("""
- **Existing methods** often rely on CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) to process images or use facial key points to capture changes in facial geometry.
- **Widely used** in research and everyday applications.

st.header('Problem Definition')
st.markdown("""
**Problem:**

- How can facial expressions be accurately recognized in real-time scenarios using facial detection systems?

**Motivation:**

- While current facial expression recognition systems are effective, they often struggle with real-time performance and robustness. By combining facial key points and image data, we aim to develop a more efficient and robust system.
